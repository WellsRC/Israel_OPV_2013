## LHrisk
The likelihood distribution for the relative risk

## MLHRisk
Log-likelihood function used to estimate the risk of infection for the aware and unaware

## NEAAware
Calculates and outputs the payoff to vaccinate minus the payoff not to vaccinate for the specific player for the baseline model

## NEAwareHet
Calculates and outputs the payoff to vaccinate minus the payoff not to vaccinate for the specified player for the model with prosocial in the unaware population

## SolveNEHet
Determines the NE solution for the model where prosocial behaviour is in the unaware population

## TPP
Runs the prosocial scenario for the estimated probability of infection


## TPR
Runs the individualistic scenario for the estimated probability of infection

## Table Values
Generates the output for the tables of the different probability of infections

## gammaEstimate
Runs optimization to find sensitivity of infection
